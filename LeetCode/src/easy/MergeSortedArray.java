/**
 * You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
 *
 * Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
 *
 * The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1.
 * To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored.
 * nums2 has a length of n.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
 * Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
 * Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
 * The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *     nums1.length == m + n
 *     nums2.length == n
 *     0 <= m, n <= 200
 *     1 <= m + n <= 200
 *     -109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109
 *
 * Time Complexity O(m+n)
